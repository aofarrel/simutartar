 [simutator](https://github.com/iqbal-lab-org/simutator) + [ART](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/index.cfm) in WDL. Simulate variants and Illumina reads from a ref genome.

 Not throughly tested and known to be very slow on the ART step. Use at your own risk.

 Sample inputs are based on arguments found in additional file 1 from:
